# CONAN-SP

CONAN-SP is a a new dataset for Spanish counter-narrative. It include a hate-speech comment (HS) and the corresponded counter-narrative (CN). 

# How is constructed?

![CONAN-SP Scheme](https://github.com/sinai-uja/CONAN-SP/blob/main/CONAN-SP.jpg)

CONAN-SP is based on CONAN-KN ([Yi-Ling Chung et al. , 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.79.pdf)). CONAN-KN consists of 195 HS-CN pairs covering multiple hate targets (islamophobia, misogyny, antisemitism, racism, and homophobia), provided along with the relevant knowledge automatically retrieved. Since CONAN-KN is in English, we use DeepL, an automatic translator tool to translate English pairs to Spanish.

To construct CONAN-SP, we remove the pairs that contain duplicates of hate-speech texts and the examples used to calculate the agreement between annotators. The structure of CONAN-SP is the hate-speech provided by CONAN-KN and the counter-narrative texts generated by GPT-3 model. We do not apply any filter to the CN generated by GPT-3. Furthermore, we associated the target of the offensive comment with the hate speech and counter-narrative pair.

To obtain the CN generated by GPT-3, we follow 3 different prompt strategies:
- **Exp1: General prompt** task definition + 5 examples (1 for each target).
- **Exp2: 5 Specific prompt** (1 for target) task definition + 3 examples for the same target.
- **Exp3: General prompt** 5 examples (1 for each target)


  
|Experiment | #Instances|
|--|--|
|Experiment 1| 84|
|Experiment 2| 70|
|Experiment 3| 84|



  
Finally, we obtained 238 pairs of hate-speech and counter-narrative among the 3 experiments. All of these pairs are labeled by human annotatorsin different proposed metrics (Offensiveness, Stance, and Informativeness).
